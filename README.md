## Installation
Set up your environment - https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=ios&device=simulated

If you cloned repository, run this command to install all necessary packages:

```
yarn install
```

In the project files there is .env.example, you need to change this to .env and specify API_KEY for OpenAI (EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY).

## Running the project

Use

```
yarn start
```

Then, according to the commands in the console, you can run the application on the selected device.

## Note
I know it's not a perfect version and there are some shortcomings but for (the final) one evening I'm satisfied. :) I'd be happy to talk about what the possibilities are. I did this on ios, it is possible that on android some changes need to be made.
